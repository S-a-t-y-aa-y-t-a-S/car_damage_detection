Developed a high-performance car damage detection model for the insurance sector using the YOLOv8 framework. Employing transfer learning, we significantly accelerated model training while achieving robust performance. A comprehensive dataset encompassing diverse damage types was utilized to train the model to accurately identify and localize ten distinct damage categories. With a scope of improvement, the model demonstrated mean Average Precision (mAP) score, surpassing 0.51 mAP on our validation set. This model was successfully deployed as a user-friendly Streamlit-based web application, enabling efficient damage assessment and streamlining insurance claims processing.
